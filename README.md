Mount s3 bucket to Xcode 
--
This code uses the AWSS3 library to interact with the S3 bucket. Make sure to replace "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY" and "YOUR_BUCKET_NAME" with the appropriate values for your S3 bucket.

You'll also need to add the AWS SDK for iOS to your Xcode project. You can do this by following the instructions on the AWS SDK for iOS website.
